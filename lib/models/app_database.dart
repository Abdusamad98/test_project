      Business Process Management is a disciplinary approach to identify, design, execute, document, measure, monitor, control and improve business processes, automated or not, to achieve consistent results, aligned with the strategical goals of the organization.
      BPO is a growing concept adopted by many companies nowadays. It is about outsourcing the services that are essential, but not part of your core business. Therefore, it is much more efficient to hire the specialized services of another company; with all the hardware available and labor you need, without having to spend thousands of dollars.
      Business process management is not only about automating. The quality of the processes and activities is a priority! BPM is a project that has to be part of the company’s culture. It never ends, being a repeated and everlasting development.

      Mobile application development is the process of making software for smartphones, tablets and digital assistants, most commonly for the Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or accessed through a mobile web browser. The programming and markup languages used for this kind of software development include Java, Swift, C# and HTML5.
      Mobile app development is rapidly growing. From retail, telecommunications and e-commerce to insurance, healthcare and government, organizations across industries must meet user expectations for real-time, convenient ways to conduct transactions and access information. Today, mobile devices—and the mobile applications that unlock their value—are the most popular way for people and businesses to connect to the internet. To stay relevant, responsive and successful, organizations need to develop the mobile applications that their customers, partners and employees demand.
      Yet mobile application development might seem daunting. Once you’ve selected the OS platform or platforms, you need to overcome the limitations of mobile devices and usher your app all the way past the potential hurdles of distribution. Fortunately, by following a few basic guidelines and best practices, you can streamline your application development journey.
