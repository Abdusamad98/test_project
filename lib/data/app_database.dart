      Business Process Management is a disciplinary approach to identify, design, execute, document, measure, monitor, control and improve business processes, automated or not, to achieve consistent results, aligned with the strategical goals of the organization.
      BPO is a growing concept adopted by many companies nowadays. It is about outsourcing the services that are essential, but not part of your core business. Therefore, it is much more efficient to hire the specialized services of another company; with all the hardware available and labor you need, without having to spend thousands of dollars.
      Business process management is not only about automating. The quality of the processes and activities is a priority! BPM is a project that has to be part of the company‚Äôs culture. It never ends, being a repeated and everlasting development.
